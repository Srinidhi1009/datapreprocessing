Task 1: Data Preprocessing - Clean and normalize dataset using Pandas + Sklearn.
Got it ✅ You want a **dedicated README just for Task 1 (Data Preprocessing)**.
Here’s a detailed version you can put in a separate `README.md` for Task 1:

---

## 📖 Overview
Data preprocessing is the first and most important step in any 
machine learning workflow. It ensures that the dataset is clean, 
consistent, and properly formatted for modeling.  

In this task:
- A sample dataset is created with **Age** and **Salary**.  
- Data normalization is performed using **StandardScaler**.  
- The resulting dataset is ready for further machine learning tasks.  

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Create a dataset using Pandas.  
2. Inspect the dataset (structure, types, values).  
3. Apply normalization on salary data using StandardScaler.  
4. Print the final preprocessed dataset.  

---
## 📊 Expected Output

A DataFrame with the original data and a new **scaled salary column**:

```
   Age  Salary  Salary_Scaled
0   25   50000      -1.183216
1   30   60000      -0.507093
2   35   75000       0.507093
3   40   90000       1.183216
```

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

---

## 🚀 How to Run

Run the script:

```bash
python task1_preprocessing.py
```

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Handle missing values in the dataset.
* Encode categorical variables.
* Add feature scaling methods (MinMaxScaler, RobustScaler).
* Automate preprocessing steps into a reusable pipeline.

👉 Do you want me to now write **separate READMEs for Task 2, Task 3, and Task 4** in the same detailed style, so each task has its own documentation?
